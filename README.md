# Black Friday Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the Black Friday sales dataset to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict purchase amounts.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transaction records, including details about customers, products, and purchase amounts. Key features include:

- **User\_ID, Product\_ID**: Unique identifiers
- **Gender, Age, City\_Category**: Customer demographics
- **Stay\_In\_Current\_City\_Years**: Duration of stay in the current city
- **Product\_Category\_1, 2, 3**: Product categories
- **Purchase**: Purchase amount (target variable)

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature selection & transformation
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing gender, age group, and city-wise purchase trends
   - Identifying top-selling product categories
3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Feature engineering for predictive modeling
   - Training models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
   - Evaluating model performance

## Results

- Male customers contribute to a higher purchase amount.
- Customers in the age group 26-35 are the most active buyers.
- Certain product categories are more popular than others.
- Machine learning models can predict purchase amounts with reasonable accuracy.
